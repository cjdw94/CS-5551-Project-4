# Simple Backend written in Node.JS

Very simple backend for conceptual understanding - will be adapted to Python/Flask.

Open a terminal/command prompt and from within the <i>ex_simple_backend_in_node directory</i>,

```sh
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```

<i>(Note that npm dependencies required for this code to work are <b>cors</b>, <b>express</b>, and <b>formidable</b>.)</i>

From within Postman (or other preferred testing method), attempt to POST a file to:

```sh
http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload
```
