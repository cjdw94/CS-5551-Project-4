# Intro
Our team chose "Model as a Service" for our semester project.   For the second iteration of our development process, we have been working towards creating a simple GUI interface that will be able to access available deep learning model API's. 
 The current direction of this iteration is so that we may learn the basics and transition towards the next phase, which is deploying a service to access various models.
